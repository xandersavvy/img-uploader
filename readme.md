# A simple Image Uploader üñºÔ∏èüñºÔ∏è
There is 3 directory 
- backend : As the name suggest it contains backend portion of the app I have used Spring with maven and mongodb in local.So make sure you have mongodb and sping installed in local . If your mongo is cloud hosted updte the application.properties as such.Open in your favorite ide and run from there.I have used Intellij idea communtiy for this 
- frontend: As the name suggests this is the frontend folder. open this in terminal then do
```
    npm i
    npm run dev
```
I have used react with vite , typescript and tailwind a simple setup nothing fancy.it does the work.
- images: here I am serving the static files.So, i am using this as a server for my stored image file.Also I am actually writing the images on the disk.I have used http-server for this.open this in terminal then do
```
    npm i
    npm run dev
```
